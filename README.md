## 🧪 Methods Summary

- Bidirectional two-sample Mendelian randomization
- GWAS summary statistics:
  - Leukocyte telomere length (UK Biobank)
  - Multiple sclerosis progression (IMSGC)
- Primary estimator: inverse-variance weighted (IVW)
- Extensive sensitivity analyses:
  - MR-Egger, weighted median/mode
  - MR-PRESSO, RadialMR
  - MR-RAPS, MR-Lasso, MR-cML, dIVW, MBE
  - Steiger directionality tests

Full methodological details are described in the published article.

## ⚠️ Notes

- Original GWAS data are publicly available from the respective consortia.
- No individual-level data are included.
